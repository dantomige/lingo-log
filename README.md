# 📓 Lingo Log

**Turn your search history into a living vocabulary.**

Lingo Log is a Chrome Extension that transforms the "lost" words from your daily browsing into a structured learning tool. It captures your search intent, enriches words with context, and bridges the gap between a quick Google search and long-term memory.
